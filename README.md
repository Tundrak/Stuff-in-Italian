# Stuff-in-Italian
This is just a collection of casual things I've done and there probably won't be any useful stuff in here, but if you see a thing you need feel free to download it! **(No support or updates provided)**

Python (https://python.org/downloads) and for .pyw files the module PySimpleGUI (https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI) WILL be required.
